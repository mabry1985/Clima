## Description
A weather app built to learn Swift, Xcode, and iOS/tvOS development.

## Features

* On app launch a get request is made to OpenWeather's API using the devices CoreLocation, that is parsed and stored in memory and another API call to Unsplash is made using the city name and weather condition to populate the background image.

* Selecting the search icon allows user to enter a city and state/country to retrieve the weather data from that locale

* Selecting the 5 icon gives the user a 5 day forecast for the current locale ( currently populated using dummy data due to API account level)

* Selecting the pointer icon retrieves the current location and updates the features accordingly 

## Design
